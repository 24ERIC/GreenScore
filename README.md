# GreenScore

# What is it:

- help you to find environmental friendly product with single click, automatically fetches and displays product information, eliminating the need for additional research

# How I made it:

- I use JS to implement logic and search product webpages for information such as ingredients, manufacturer, packaging, and other details
- I use HTML and CSS to design the interface for product information and sustainability evaluation score
- I also use OpenAI model to evaluate the product based on a specified set of parameters to generate an overall sustainability score.

# Challenges I face

- Every product in amazon has little different layouts and field ID, difficult to scraping data
- Also if I upload OpenAI API keys to github, it will not working anymore, without notice me, cause me a long time to figure out
